# Face-Detection-App
A beautiful Face Detection application, which uses the "Clarifai API" for the face recognition, React for the front end NodeJS and express for the back end and PostgreSQL for the database management.

I created this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
